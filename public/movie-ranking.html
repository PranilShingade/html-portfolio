<h3>The Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>A janitor at MIT, Will Hunting has a gift for math and chemistry that can take him light-years beyond his blue-collar
roots, but he doesn't realize his potential and can't even imagine leaving his childhood Boston South End neighborhood,
his construction job, or his best friend. To complicate matters, several strangers enter the equation: a brilliant math
professor who discovers, even envies, Will's gifts, an empathetic shrink who identifies with Will's blue-collar roots,
and a beautiful, gifted pre-med student who shows him, for the first time in his life, the possibility of love</p>

<h3>The Big Fish</h3>
<p>When Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) becomes ill, his son, William (Billy Crudup), travels to be with him. William has a
strained relationship with Edward because his father has always told exaggerated stories about his life, and William
thinks he's never really told the truth. Even on his deathbed, Edward recounts fantastical anecdotes. When William, who
is a journalist, starts to investigate his father's tales, he begins to understand the man and his penchant for
storytelling.</p>

<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>Following the closing arguments in a murder trial, the 12 members of the jury must deliberate, with a guilty verdict
meaning death for the accused, an inner-city teen. As the dozen men try to reach a unanimous decision while sequestered
in a room, one juror (Henry Fonda) casts considerable doubt on elements of the case. Personal issues soon rise to the
surface, and conflict threatens to derail the delicate process that will decide one boy's fate</p>
